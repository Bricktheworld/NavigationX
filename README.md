iPhone X gestures on android with animations (unreleased)


This is an abandoned project (because I got android 10 on my device lol so I already have these gestures)

This project is also extremely buggy, it is not recommended you lay eyes on the code as it is 600 lines of code written in one go without a second thought. If you decide to take the journey, drugs are recommended to be taken both before and after. 
Do not attempt (both looking at this code and taking drugs) without consulting your doctor

yeah, im never gonna try and work on this project again, have fun looking at the mess of code
